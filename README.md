# 🎓 Undergraduate B.Tech Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I developed during my **Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)** course.  
Each project reflects my learning journey across various programming languages and technologies including **C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**.  
The projects demonstrate core concepts such as algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, web development, and scripting.

## 🧩 Projects Overview

### **C Projects**
- **Data Structures Implementation:**  
  Implementation of fundamental data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees in C.  
  Includes operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

- **Sorting Algorithms:**  
  Implementations of sorting algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Merge Sort**, with performance comparisons.

---

### **Java Projects**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Demo:**  
  A Java application demonstrating OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction — implemented through a **banking system** or **inventory management system**.

- **GUI Application:**  
  A simple graphical user interface (GUI) project using **Java Swing** or **JavaFX** — examples include a **calculator** or a **mini-game**.

---

### **Python Projects**
- **Data Analysis Script:**  
  A Python script using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to analyze datasets, perform statistical operations, and visualize data (e.g., student performance analysis).

- **Automation Tool:**  
  A Python automation script for tasks like **file organization**, **web scraping** (BeautifulSoup), or a **basic chatbot** using simple NLP techniques.

---

### **Web Development Projects (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP)**
- **Personal Portfolio Website:**  
  A responsive portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
  Includes sections like *About Me*, *Projects*, and *Contact Form*.

- **Dynamic Web App:**  
  A full-stack web project using **PHP** (for backend) and **MySQL** (for database) — examples include a **blog system** or **e-commerce prototype**.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  A **JavaScript-based dashboard** using **Chart.js** for data visualization, integrated with a PHP backend for real-time data fetching.

> Each project includes source code and may contain documentation, sample inputs/outputs, or test cases.
